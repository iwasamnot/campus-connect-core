## Setup Instructions

1. **Install Dependencies**
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. **Configure Firebase**
   - **Find your project**: Your project ID is `campus-connect-sistc`
     - Direct link: https://console.firebase.google.com/project/campus-connect-sistc
     - See `FIND_MY_PROJECT.md` for detailed instructions if you can't find it
   - **If project doesn't exist**: Create a new Firebase project at [Firebase Console](https://console.firebase.google.com/)
   - **Enable Authentication**:
     - **Email/Password**: Go to Authentication → Sign-in method → Enable Email/Password
   - **Create a Firestore database**:
     - Go to Firestore Database → Create database
     - Start in test mode (you'll update rules later)
   - **Enable Firebase Storage** (Required for file uploads):
     - Go to Storage → Get Started
     - Choose a location and enable
     - See `ENABLE_STORAGE.md` for detailed instructions
   - **Update Firestore security rules** from `firestore.rules`
   - **Get your Firebase configuration values** from Firebase Console → Project Settings → General → Your apps

3. **Configure Environment Variables**
   - Create a `.env` file in the root directory (copy from `.env.example`)
   - Add your Firebase configuration:
     ```
     VITE_FIREBASE_API_KEY=your-firebase-api-key
     VITE_FIREBASE_AUTH_DOMAIN=your-project.firebaseapp.com
     VITE_FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID=your-project-id
     VITE_FIREBASE_STORAGE_BUCKET=your-project.firebasestorage.app
     VITE_FIREBASE_MESSAGING_SENDER_ID=your-messaging-sender-id
     VITE_FIREBASE_APP_ID=your-app-id
     VITE_FIREBASE_MEASUREMENT_ID=your-measurement-id
     ```
   - Add your AI API keys (Optional):
     ```
     VITE_OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-your-openai-api-key-here
     VITE_GEMINI_API_KEY=your-gemini-api-key-here
     ```
   - **OpenAI API Key**: Get from https://platform.openai.com/api-keys (for AI Help Assistant)
   - **Gemini API Key**: Get from https://makersuite.google.com/app/apikey (for Virtual Senior in Campus Chat)
   - **Important**: Restart the dev server after adding environment variables
   - If no API keys are provided, the AI will use the local knowledge base
   - **Note**: The app will use fallback values if environment variables are not set (for backward compatibility)

4. **Run Development Server**
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```
   
   **Note**: If you added an OpenAI API key, make sure to restart the dev server for it to take effect.

4. **Build for Production**
   ```bash
   npm run build
   ```

## Firebase Configuration

<<<<<<< HEAD
The Firebase configuration is now managed through environment variables for better security and flexibility.

### Local Development
Create a `.env` file in the root directory with your Firebase configuration (see `.env.example` for template):

```env
VITE_FIREBASE_API_KEY=your-firebase-api-key
VITE_FIREBASE_AUTH_DOMAIN=your-project.firebaseapp.com
VITE_FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID=your-project-id
VITE_FIREBASE_STORAGE_BUCKET=your-project.firebasestorage.app
VITE_FIREBASE_MESSAGING_SENDER_ID=your-messaging-sender-id
VITE_FIREBASE_APP_ID=your-app-id
VITE_FIREBASE_MEASUREMENT_ID=your-measurement-id
```

Get these values from Firebase Console → Project Settings → General → Your apps → Web app config.

**Note**: The app includes fallback values for backward compatibility, but it's recommended to use environment variables.
## Firestore Rules

Make sure to set up proper Firestore security rules. See `FIRESTORE_RULES.txt` for the complete, up-to-date rules.

The rules include comprehensive security for all collections:
- **Messages**: Read/create for all authenticated users, edit/delete for authors and admins
  - Supports reactions, replies, mentions, attachments, read receipts, pinning
- **Group Messages**: Same permissions as messages, for group chats
- **Private Chats**: Participants can read/write, private messaging with subcollections

- **Users**: Read for all, create/update own profile, admins can manage all users
- **Reports**: Create for all users, read/update/delete for admins only
- **Audit Logs**: Create for all users (system logging), read/delete for admins only
- **Typing Indicators**: Users can manage their own typing status
- **Pinned Messages**: All users can read, admins can pin/unpin
- **Saved Messages**: Users can only access their own saved messages
- **Scheduled Messages**: Users can only manage their own scheduled messages

```javascript
rules_version = '2';
service cloud.firestore {
  match /databases/{database}/documents {
    // Helper function to check if user is admin
    function isAdmin() {
      return request.auth != null && 
        (get(/databases/$(database)/documents/users/$(request.auth.uid)).data.role == 'admin' ||
         get(/databases/$(database)/documents/users/$(request.auth.uid)).data.role == 'admin1');
    }
    
    // Messages collection - supports editing, reactions, and reporting
    match /messages/{messageId} {
      allow read: if request.auth != null;
      allow create: if request.auth != null;
      allow update: if request.auth != null && (
        (resource.data.userId == request.auth.uid && 
         request.resource.data.diff(resource.data).affectedKeys().hasOnly(['text', 'displayText', 'toxic', 'edited', 'editedAt', 'reactions'])) ||
        isAdmin()
      );
      allow delete: if request.auth != null && (
        resource.data.userId == request.auth.uid ||
        isAdmin()
      );
    }
    
    // Users collection - supports presence tracking
    match /users/{userId} {
      allow read: if request.auth != null;
      allow create: if request.auth != null && request.auth.uid == userId;
      allow update: if request.auth != null && request.auth.uid == userId && (
        isAdmin() ||
        (request.resource.data.diff(resource.data).affectedKeys().hasOnly(['studentEmail', 'personalEmail', 'phoneNumber', 'updatedAt', 'lastSeen', 'isOnline']))
      );
      allow delete: if isAdmin();
    }
    
    // Reports collection
    match /reports/{reportId} {
      allow create: if request.auth != null;
      allow read, update, delete: if isAdmin();
    }
    
    // Audit logs collection
    match /auditLogs/{logId} {
      allow read: if isAdmin();
      allow create: if isAuthenticated();
      allow update: if false; // Audit logs should never be updated
      allow delete: if isAdmin();
    }

    // Saved messages collection
    match /savedMessages/{savedMessageId} {
      allow read, create, update, delete: if isAuthenticated() && 
        resource.data.userId == request.auth.uid;
    }

    // Scheduled messages collection
    match /scheduledMessages/{scheduledMessageId} {
      allow read, create, update: if isAuthenticated() && 
        resource.data.userId == request.auth.uid;
      allow delete: if isAuthenticated() && (
        resource.data.userId == request.auth.uid || isAdmin()
      );
    }

    // Groups, Private Chats, Group Messages, Typing Indicators, Pinned Messages
    // (Full rules available in firestore.rules file)
  }
}
```

## Automatic Deployment

This project is configured with **automatic deployment** to Firebase Hosting via GitHub Actions.

### How It Works

- **Trigger**: Every push to the `master` branch automatically triggers deployment
- **Process**: 
  1. GitHub Actions checks out your code
  2. Installs dependencies (`npm ci`)
  3. Builds the project (`npm run build`)
  4. Deploys to Firebase Hosting
  5. Your site is live within minutes

### Setup GitHub Secrets (One-Time)

For automatic deployment to work, you need to set up GitHub Secrets:

1. Go to your GitHub repository → **Settings** → **Secrets and variables** → **Actions**
2. Add the following secrets:
